# TestAnalyzer
## When use testanalysis?
Testanalysis is essential to decide which tests
- one has to make to avoid certain risks
- one can leave out to spare time and money with respect to avoid most risky cases


# LogAnalyzer
## Use logs to analyze complex behaviour of machines or software
U will never be that fast that you can look at 8 places at the same time and decide for every place in your machine that movements were less than 0.1 mm, temperatures rised less than 2° and any other little or fast or 'unhuman' event happened

# Logfiles will!

Measuring or analysing software by the means of data collected, be it software-variables or real measured items, helps decide whether funcionality is fulfilled or missed it's purpose.
